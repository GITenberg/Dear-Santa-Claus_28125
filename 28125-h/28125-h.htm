<p>Kate and Dick had a good many pets. There were Frisk and Ponto and
Fuss and another little dog called Fly. There was the pony, Fleet, and
the newest pet of all was a dear little colt that Kate's papa had
given to her for her very own because the pony she rode really
belonged to Dick.</p>

<p>This colt she had named Fairy, and she took great care of it. Fly and
Fairy were good friends, and they had a funny way of looking at each
other that made the children laugh.</p>

<p>Then the baby that they all loved lived here. Her name was May, and
she was Kate's sister. She was a sweet little thing, just beginning to
walk and to talk. She could say "chicky" quite plainly, and she liked
to toddle out and watch the little girls feed the chickens.</p>

<p>But I can't begin to tell you all the good times the children had that
summer. They were happy all the time, and grandma said they were so
good that it was really no trouble at all to have them there.</p>

                                                                        <!-- page 26 -->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page06.png" alt="" width="346" height="430" />

<p>But at last one Saturday evening, papa, who always came out from the
city to spend Sunday with them, said they must start for home the next
Monday.</p>

<p>They did want to stay longer, but papa laughed and said, "Christmas is
coming now, you know, and Santa Claus couldn't bring things way out
here as easy as he could get them to you in town."</p>

<p>Then the children began to think of Christmas and to tease grandpa and
grandma to come and spend it with them, and of course papa and mamma
teased too; so at last they promised, and the children said good-by to
their pets and to Kate and May and Dick and went away shouting?</p>

<p>"Good-by, grandma. Now remember you promised!"</p>
                                                                       <!-- page 27 -->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the children reached home they talked of grandma's nearly all
the time when they were not talking of Christmas, and Bessie wrote a
letter to Santa Claus asking him to be sure and bring a pair of his
nicest gold-bowed spectacles for grandma because she had lost her old
ones, and not to forget a gold-headed cane for grandpa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page28.png" alt="" width="284" height="293" />

<p>At last Christmas Eve came, and grandma and grandpa were there, and
the children hung up their stockings, and Bessie said that grandma and
grandpa must be sure and hang up theirs too; then, after they had gone
to bed, the smaller children whispered for a long time about Santa
Claus and listened to hear his sleigh bells on the roof.</p>

<p>"I don't see how he can get down the chimney," whispered Bessie. "You
know he's so fat in all his pictures."</p>

<p>"Maybe he takes off his coat," whispered Clara, "then he wouldn't be
quite so big." But she didn't see how he could get down the chimney,
either.</p>

<p>Once or twice they were sure they heard him on the roof, and they<!-- page 29 -->
covered up their heads so he wouldn't think they were peeping, and at
last they went to sleep before they knew it.</p>

<p>Willie and Tom were just as anxious as the little girls, and whispered
just as much, and they all dreamed of Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>
<img src="images/page08b.png" alt="" width="341" height="258" /></p>

<p>Bessie and Clara were the first ones up. They shouted with delight
when they looked in their stockings. There was a dear little dolly in
each stocking&mdash;a dolly with real hair and eyes that opened and shut,
and the dollies were dressed very prettily. They were too large to go
into the stockings, so they just stood in them, looking as though they
were ready to jump down.</p>

<p>Willie found the funniest jumping-jack in his stocking, and Tom pulled
a flute out of his. He had everybody awake in no time after that.</p>

<p>Grace was happy when she looked in her stocking. There was a little<!-- page 30 -->
plush box in it, and in the box was a lovely gold watch; while Harry
found just what he wanted too&mdash;a pair of skates.</p>

<p>But grandma and grandpa were surprised when they discovered the
spectacles and the cane.</p>

<p>"Who in the world could have told Santa what we wanted most?" said
grandma.</p>

<p>Grandpa said he couldn't understand it either, and then Bessie had to
tell the secret.</p>

<p>She ran up to each of them and whispered, "I wrote to him myself!"</p>

<p>Then how they kissed her.</p>

<p>All day long the library was kept closed; not a child was allowed to
peep in. But what fun they had all day, and what a Christmas dinner,
with a plum pudding as big as a pumpkin.</p>

<p>In the evening the library door was opened, and there was the
prettiest Christmas tree, all blazing with candles and hung with
pretty things; while piled around it were books and toys and
everything that everybody wanted most.</p>

<p>And just think of it! There, lying in front of the tree and looking as
happy as the children themselves, was a great, big, noble dog, who got
up and came to meet them as they trooped in.</p>

<p>"Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!" cried Bessie, bending to pat his head. "What's your<!-- page 31 -->
name, you great, big darling? Ooo! Ooo! Whose is he, papa?"</p>

<p>"Ask Santa Claus," said papa; and sure enough, Santa Claus stepped out
from behind the tree.</p>

<p>"His name is on his collar," said Santa Claus. Then the children all
rushed for him for they knew it was grandpa dressed up like Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>
<img src="images/page10.png" alt="" width="350" height="234" /></p>

<p>Afterwards Bessie spelled out the dog's name, "C-a-r-l-o," on his
collar, and her own name on a card which was tied to it, and she was
the happiest little girl in the world.</p>

<p>But everyone else was happy too, and they all said it was the very
merriest Christmas they had ever seen, and Clara and Bessie dreamed
that Santa Claus told them he himself had never had so much fun before.</p>

<p class="cap">ONE summer Alma and her brother Philip spent their vacation with their
auntie, who lived in a beautiful village, so near the pretty country
that they could take a ride out into it on their wheels, at any time
they wished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page32b" id="page32b"></a>
<img src="images/page32b.png" alt="" width="421" height="258" /></p>

<p>They both rode very well indeed, and they were always finding pretty
little spots along the road-side, where they played camp out; for
auntie let them take a lunch if they wanted to, and the air was so
fresh and pure that they were hungry almost all the time.</p>

                                                                        <!-- page 33 -->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page33a.png" alt="" width="119" height="103" />

<p>One morning they started off quite early with their wheels and their
lunch, and they rode out into the country on a pretty road where they
had never been before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page33b.png" alt="" width="195" height="101" />

<p>It had great trees along the side and a little river winding along
with it, and they saw the cattle and horses in the fields, and the
hens and chickens and turkeys and geese along the road-side, and once
they got off their wheels to talk to a pretty bossy and her calf that
were very near the fence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page33c" id="page33c"></a>
<img src="images/page33c.png" alt="" width="344" height="149" /></p>

<p>The bossy was a little afraid they might hurt her baby, so she wasn't
quite friendly. But she didn't try to drive them away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page33d.png" alt="" width="167" height="94" />

                                                                        <!-- page 34 -->
<p>At one side of a farm-house near, a big dog was lying in his kennel,
and a great black cat came up to him very slyly and tapped him on the
nose with one paw. It was funny to see the dog jump up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page34a.png" alt="" width="169" height="160" />

<p>The birds sang, and the hens and chickens talked to each other, and
once or twice they stopped to let a flock of geese cross the road in
front of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page34b.png" alt="" width="144" height="112" />

<p>Then they came upon a big flock of turkeys, and the gobbler put on
airs and pretended he was going to stop them; but they flew past and
laughed at him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page34c.png" alt="" width="126" height="107" />

<p>By the side of the road in one place, a big, fat, clean-looking pig
was standing, sunning himself; but when he saw them, he ran away,
squealing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page34d.png" alt="" width="172" height="100" />

<p>"You needn't run from us," Philip called after him; "we don't want any
pork to-day&mdash;we've got chicken for our lunch."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page34e.png" alt="" width="120" height="109" />

<p>"Yes," said Alma, "and nice, fresh strawberries, and everything good."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page35a.png" alt="" width="137" height="121" /><!-- page 35 -->

<p>They saw a big dog lying near a chicken-coop, with the chickens
running over him just as they pleased, and Philip called out again,"Be
careful, you little fellows, or you might happen to run down his
throat."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page35b.png" alt="" width="161" height="99" />

<p>They got off their wheels and walked for a little while just for fun;
and all at once, as they were passing a barn, Alma cried, "Look! Did
you see that cat after the mouse?"</p>

<p>Philip said he didn't; but pretty soon Mrs Pussy came out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page35c" id="page35c"></a>
<img src="images/page35c.png" alt="" width="353" height="167" /></p>

<p>"You didn't get it, did you?" said Alma. "Well, you're fat enough now;
you don't need to catch mice."</p>

<p>They stopped to eat their lunch under a clump of trees not very far
from a pleasant farm-house. There was a cunning little fat dog lying
in front of the house, and as they watched him, up came a bee and lit
on his nose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page36a.png" alt="" width="179" height="126" /><!-- page 36 -->
<p>The little doggy jumped up and barked at the bee; then he sat down and
put up his nose in a friendly way, to see what it was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page36b.png" alt="" width="216" height="129" />

<p>"Look out, sir!" cried Philip. "You'll get hurt!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page36c.png" alt="" width="157" height="168" />

<p>But he spoke just a little too late, for puppy-dog found out his
mistake, and the next minute he was running away and yelping at the
top of his voice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page36d.png" alt="" width="188" height="125" />

<p>"The poor little thing!" said Alma. "Wasn't that too bad?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page36e.png" alt="" width="136" height="91" />

<p>"Yes," said Philip, "but he'll get over it pretty quick, and I can't
help laughing, it did look so funny."</p>

<p>When they went back to their auntie's, they told her that was the best
bicycle ride they had ever had.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
